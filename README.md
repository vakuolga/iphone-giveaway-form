# iPhone Giveaway Form

A responsive web form project created as part of a test assignment. The project demonstrates my ability to work with design assets, implement a user-friendly form with responsive behavior, and handle creative challenges like recreating missing assets.

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Functional modal windows for "Advertise," "Terms and Conditions," and "Privacy Policy."
- Custom clipping applied to a provided image to remove unnecessary padding.
- Recreation of iPhone mockups with shadowing and consistent wallpaper for aesthetic uniformity.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for responsiveness and visual design.
- **JavaScript**: Functional modal windows and form validation.
